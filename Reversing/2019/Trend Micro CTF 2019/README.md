# Trend Micro CTF 2019 - Notes

> Category: Reversing
> Points: 100
> Steganography can be used to hide payloads, commands, IP, etc. This is a Windows Reverse Engineering challenge and to get the flag you'll need to reverse a PE file. You only need this executable file to solve the challenge, but as we know, there's a big world inside each file.

> Note: some AV will flag the binary as malicious.

> Download the file
> Extract the downloaded file by using the following password.
> Optional: Check integrity of 7z file by comparing file SHA256 checksum.
> Command to check SHA256 checksum:
> Linux: sha256sum filename.7z
> Windows: certUtil -hashfile filename.7z SHA256

> Much Ado About Nothing

> We found a binary but we're not sure what it does. It was left with a note that just says "nothing is important" but we're not sure what that was supposed to mean. Can you help us figure it out?

> Download the file
> Extract the downloaded file by using the following password.
> Optional: Check integrity of 7z file by comparing file SHA256 checksum.
> Command to check SHA256 checksum:
> Linux: sha256sum filename.7z
> Windows: certUtil -hashfile filename.7z SHA256

## 300

> Category: Reversing
> Points: 300
> Flag of Righteousness

> The flag can be obtained from somewhere within the tmctf.zip file. Good luck!

> Download the file
> Extract the downloaded file by using the following password.
> Optional: Check integrity of 7z file by comparing file SHA256 checksum.
> Command to check SHA256 checksum:
> Linux: sha256sum filename.7z
> Windows: certUtil -hashfile filename.7z SHA256

## 400

> Category: Reversing
> Points: 400
> Speak my Language is a challenge that consists of a simple custom Binary Encoded Instruction Set (BEIS) called Hecate. The challenge is to write a program that computes the Shannon entropy of the quote "Life is trying things to see if they work." (excluding double quotes) from far away. If successful, you should get the correct flag.

> Pay special attention to every hint given to you.

> Note: some AV will flag the binary as malicious.

> Remember to enjoy it!
