## The Numbers
![the_numbers](./The%20Numbers/the_numbers.png)
> The numbers... what do they mean?

## 13
> Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

## Easy1
> The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this [table](./Easy1/table.txt) to solve it?.

## caesar
> Decrypt this [message](./caesar/ciphertext). You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar_4_33e5994add902b2321c8c38c8b962eff on the shell server.

## Flags
![flags](./Flags/flag.png)
> What do the flags mean?

## Mr-Worldwide
> A musician left us a [message](./Mr-Worldwide/message.txt). What's it mean?

## la cifra de
> I found this cipher in an old book. Can you figure out what it says? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 32203.

## rsa-pop-quiz
> Class, take your seats! It's PRIME-time for a quiz... nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 41419

## miniRSA
> Lets decrypt this: [ciphertext](./miniRSA/ciphertext)? Something seems a bit small

## AES-ABC
> AES-ECB is bad, so I rolled my own cipher block chaining mechanism - Addition Block Chaining! You can find the source here: [aes-abc.py](./AES-ABC/aes-abc.py). The AES-ABC flag is [body.enc.ppm](./AES-ABC/body.enc.ppm)

## b00tl3gRSA2
> In RSA d is alot bigger than e, why dont we use d to encrypt instead of e? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 40480.

## b00tl3gRSA3
> Why use p and q when I can use more? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 49851.
