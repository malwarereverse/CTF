> The flag has been falsely imprisoned again for being a de-serial killer. The Flag marshal has learned his lesson and made some changes to the jail. Maybe the Marshal should make some changes to his pockets because he seems to have dropped blueprint.war again ...

> Your job is simple, break into flagmarshal.xyz and free the flag. All the clues you need are in blueprint.war

> Note: Kindly adhere to the CTF rules.

> OldJitter is a JS engine that executes JS code. I use it to learn JS exploits. Try your luck!

> The same instance of the engine is deployed on ubuntu 18.04 at :

> instance 2: nc 52.44.188.179 10003

> Note: Strictly no brute force or DOS to the instances. Kindly adhere to the CTF rules.
